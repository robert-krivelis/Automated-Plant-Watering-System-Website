## About
ENEL 400 Design project to create a self-watering plant. 
Users can fill up the water storage under the plant, and then the plant will water itself when the soil gets too dry.
The website was created as an add-on to the base project to monitor the plant's humidity and temperature and allow for remotely watering the plant as required.

## Project Features
* Uses Particle.io photon wifi-connected microcontroller
* Custom built PCB to interface between MCU and sensors 
* Wood and 3D-printed enclosure with water storage tank underneath the plant
